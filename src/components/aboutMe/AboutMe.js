				<h3>
					I've always had a penchant for creativity. My life has been a continual exploration of mediums
					ranging from textiles and metalsmithing to designing for editorial publications, both print and
					digital. The common thread throughout these mediums is the fascination of making the abstract
					tangible. As a Software Engineer, my focus is on exploring this medium of computer programming -
					applying my creative and technical problem-solving skills, as well as my tenacious spirit. Because
					of my previous work environment, I'm adept at prioritizing key deliverables under tight deadlines
					and collaborating effectively across departments.
